# Cardano Search

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cardano Search repository! Cardano Search is a project aimed at providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for exploring the Cardano blockchain. Our solution simplifies the process of searching for data such as addresses and transactions, making blockchain data more accessible and understandable to a wider audience.

## Project Status
As of now, the source code for Cardano Search is not publicly available. The release and further development of Cardano Search are contingent upon the project being selected for **F11 Catalyst Funding** under the **Cardano Use Cases: Solution Category**.

## Catalyst Funding and Community Support
The Cardano Search project is a candidate for the F11 Catalyst Funding, an initiative by the Cardano Community to support innovative projects and solutions developed within the Cardano ecosystem.

By voting for Cardano Search in the **Cardano Use Cases: Solution Category**, you can help bring this project to the Cardano Community and Ecosystem.

### What Happens If Selected
